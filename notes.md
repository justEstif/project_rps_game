# Solving a Problem

- Understand and explain the problem to a duck
- the problem is that we are trying to add
- Plan
- Pseudocode and research applicable functions
- Divide and conqueor

Current problem:

- trying to write a new function called game()
  - game calls playRound 5 times
  - each time it passes in a user and computer selection for a game choice
  - it doesn't get triggered again unless the button is clicked (async)
- it calls the playRound function 5 times
- it keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end
  - we could add a helper function to deal with the scores
- might have to change some of the return values or create more helper
  functions
